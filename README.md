## Red Panda Icons

I am creating a collection of icons for all your icon needs—this is the initial set.
To install these, you need to simply use npm as I have set them up as a package. 

`npm i red_panda_icons typescript framer-motion`

This will install the icons and all their dependencies.
I hope you enjoy!
Oh, one last
thing, all the icons have multiple props when you import them to use in your project.

Example import
<br/>
<br/>
`import Cross from 'red_panda_icons/icons/Cross`
<br/>
<br/>
`<Cross dimension="46px" color="#000" onClick={() => {alert="Button Click"}}>`

This allows you to customize the color, size (dimension) and the onClick event.
Feel free
not to use these props and use the default values.
They will work the same.
The only one I suggest definitely using is onClick—so you can do things with the icon rather
than just looking pretty.
