## Red Panda Icons

I am creating a collect of icon components for use in your projects, feel free to use them for what you wish.
I have set them up as individual components, and they have been animated using Framer Motion.
The icons themselves are saved in individual folders in the components folder, allowing you to easily copy them
across to your own project.
Make sure you have installed Framer Motion as this is required for the animations to work

`npm install framer-motion`

That's it! I hope you enjoy them. I will be adding more as time goes on.
